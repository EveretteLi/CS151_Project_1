what should be in

MainScreen
    TaskBoardView (a view class should contains it's model)
    TaskBoardView.show()
TaskBoardView
    TaskBoardModel
    a way of showing TaskBoard
    button listeners
ProjectView
    ProjectModel
    a way of showing project
TaskView
    TaskModel
    a way of showing task

when main screen is showed:
    taskBoardView.show() -> projectView.show() -> taskView.show()
    if anything changed -> MainScreen.show()(to repaint everything)

relation between model and view:
    view can create model object, but model shouldn't know it's view

Model:
    act as data holder
    only store pure data
    passively change
View:
    in charge of showing stuffs
    handle user input
    actively change the state of model



Add an interface model listener:
    each model in charge of updating it's own view
    each view update in different manner
    no more static function
